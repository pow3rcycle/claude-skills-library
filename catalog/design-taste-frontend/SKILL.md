# tasteskill: Anti-Slop Frontend Skill

> **Register gate — BRAND.** Landing pages, portfolios, and redesigns. Not dashboards, not data tables, not multi-step product UI. Doctrine (`MASTER-DESIGN.md`) wins on any conflict.
> Every rule below is **contextual**. None of it fires automatically. First read the brief, then pull only what fits.

## Reference Index (load on demand — do NOT read these up front)

| File | Read it when |
|---|---|
| `references/gsap-skeletons.md` | Implementing a pinned or scrubbed scroll section — Sticky-Stack (5.A), Horizontal-Pan (5.B), Scroll-Reveal Stagger (5.C). |
| `references/pattern-vocabulary.md` | Choosing a composition, or confirming a pattern the brief names (Section 10's full vocabulary). |
| `references/design-system-appendices.md` | A design system is already chosen and you need its real install command, canonical docs, or the honest Liquid Glass approximation (Section 2's appendices). |
| `references/design-engineering-directives.md` | Choosing type or color, laying out hero / nav / bento / section rhythm, sourcing images or logos, writing on-page copy, locking the page theme (Section 4's full directives, 4.1-4.11). |
| `references/ai-tells.md` | Running the Pre-Flight Check, or about to add a label, eyebrow, caption, separator, status dot, or product preview (Section 9's full forbidden-pattern catalogue, 9.A-9.G). |

## 0. BRIEF INFERENCE (Read the Room Before Anything Else)

Before touching code or tweaking dials, **infer what the user actually wants**. Most LLM design output is bad because the model jumps to a default aesthetic instead of reading the room.

### 0.A Read these signals first
1. **Page kind** - landing (SaaS / consumer / agency / event), portfolio (dev / designer / creative studio), redesign (preserve vs overhaul), editorial / blog.
2. **Vibe words** the user used - "minimalist", "calm", "Linear-style", "Awwwards", "brutalist", "premium consumer", "Apple-y", "playful", "serious B2B", "editorial", "agency-y", "glassy", "dark tech".
3. **Reference signals** - URLs they linked, screenshots they pasted, products they named, brands they're competing with.
4. **Audience** - B2B procurement panel vs. design-conscious consumer vs. recruiter scanning a portfolio. The audience picks the aesthetic, not your taste.
5. **Brand assets that already exist** - logo, color, type, photography. For redesigns, these are starting material, not optional input (see Section 11).
6. **Quiet constraints** - accessibility-first audiences, public-sector, regulated industries, trust-first commerce, kids' products. These constraints OVERRIDE aesthetic preference.

### 0.B Output a one-line "Design Read" before generating
Before any code, state in one line: **"Reading this as: \<page kind> for \<audience>, with a \<vibe> language, leaning toward \<design system or aesthetic family>."**

Example reads:
- *"Reading this as: B2B SaaS landing for technical buyers, with a Linear-style minimalist language, leaning toward Tailwind utilities + Geist + restrained motion."*
- *"Reading this as: solo designer portfolio for hiring managers, with an editorial / kinetic-type language, leaning toward native CSS + scroll-driven animation + custom typography."*
- *"Reading this as: redesign of a public-sector service site, with a trust-first language, leaning toward GOV.UK Frontend or USWDS."*

### 0.C If the brief is ambiguous, ask one question, do not guess
Ask exactly **one** clarifying question - never a multi-question dump - and only when the design read genuinely diverges. Example: *"Should this feel closer to Linear-clean or Awwwards-experimental?"*

If you can confidently infer from context, **do not ask**. Just declare the design read and proceed.

### 0.D Anti-Default Discipline
Do not default to: AI-purple gradients, centered hero over dark mesh, three equal feature cards, generic glassmorphism on everything, infinite-loop micro-animations everywhere, Inter + slate-900. These are the LLM defaults. Reach past them deliberately based on the design read.

---

## 1. THE THREE DIALS (Core Configuration)

After the design read, set three dials. Every layout, motion, and density decision below is gated by these.

* **`DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8`** - 1 = Perfect Symmetry, 10 = Artsy Chaos
* **`MOTION_INTENSITY: 6`** - 1 = Static, 10 = Cinematic / Physics
* **`VISUAL_DENSITY: 4`** - 1 = Art Gallery / Airy, 10 = Cockpit / Packed Data

**Baseline:** `8 / 6 / 4`. Use these unless the design read overrides them. Do not ask the user to edit this file - overrides happen conversationally.

### 1.A Dial Inference (design read → dial values)
| Signal | VARIANCE | MOTION | DENSITY |
|---|---|---|---|
| "minimalist / clean / calm / editorial / Linear-style" | 5-6 | 3-4 | 2-3 |
| "premium consumer / Apple-y / luxury / brand" | 7-8 | 5-7 | 3-4 |
| "playful / wild / Dribbble / Awwwards / experimental / agency" | 9-10 | 8-10 | 3-4 |
| "landing page / portfolio / marketing site (default)" | 7-9 | 6-8 | 3-5 |
| "trust-first / public-sector / regulated / accessibility-critical" | 3-4 | 2-3 | 4-5 |
| "redesign - preserve" | match existing | +1 | match existing |
| "redesign - overhaul" | +2 | +2 | match existing |

### 1.B Use-Case Presets
| Use case | VARIANCE | MOTION | DENSITY |
|---|---|---|---|
| Landing (SaaS, mainstream) | 7 | 6 | 4 |
| Landing (Agency / creative) | 9 | 8 | 3 |
| Landing (Premium consumer) | 7 | 6 | 3 |
| Portfolio (Designer / studio) | 8 | 7 | 3 |
| Portfolio (Developer) | 6 | 5 | 4 |
| Editorial / Blog | 6 | 4 | 3 |
| Public-sector service | 3 | 2 | 5 |
| Redesign - preserve | match | match+1 | match |
| Redesign - overhaul | +2 | +2 | match |

### 1.C How the Dials Drive Output
Use these (or user-overridden values) as global variables. Cross-references throughout this document refer to these exact variable names - never invent aliases like `LAYOUT_VARIANCE` or `ANIM_LEVEL`.

---

## 2. BRIEF → DESIGN SYSTEM MAP

Once you have the design read (Section 0) and dials (Section 1), pick the right foundation. Do not invent CSS for things that have an official package. Do not pretend an aesthetic trend is an official system.

### 2.A When to reach for a real design system (use official packages)
| Brief reads as… | Reach for | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Microsoft / enterprise SaaS / dashboards | `@fluentui/react-components` or `@fluentui/web-components` | Official Fluent UI, Microsoft tokens, accessibility done |
| Google-ish UI, Material-flavored product | `@material/web` + Material 3 tokens | Official, theme-able via Material Theming |
| IBM-style B2B / enterprise analytics | `@carbon/react` + `@carbon/styles` | Official Carbon, mature data-density patterns |
| Shopify app surfaces | `polaris.js` web components / Polaris React | Required for Shopify admin UI |
| Atlassian / Jira-style product | `@atlaskit/*` + `@atlaskit/tokens` | Official Atlassian DS |
| GitHub-style devtool / community page | `@primer/css` or `@primer/react-brand` | Official Primer; Brand variant for marketing |
| Public-sector UK service | `govuk-frontend` | Legally / regulatorily expected |
| US public-sector / trust-first | `uswds` | Same |
| Fast local-business / agency MVP | Bootstrap 5.3 | Boring, fast, works |
| Modern accessible React foundation | `@radix-ui/themes` | Primitives + polished theme |
| Modern SaaS where you own the components | shadcn/ui (`npx shadcn@latest add ...`) | You own the code, easy to customise; never ship default state |
| Tailwind-based modern SaaS / AI marketing | Tailwind v4 utilities + `dark:` variant | Default for indie + small team builds |

**Honesty rule:** if the brief reads as one of the systems above, install and use the **official** package. Do not recreate its CSS by hand. Do not import a system's tokens but then override 90% of them.

**One system per project.** Do not mix Fluent React with Carbon in the same tree. Do not import shadcn/ui components into a Material 3 app.

### 2.B When the brief is an aesthetic, not a system
For these directions, there is **no single official package**. Build with native CSS + Tailwind + a maintained component library. Be honest in code comments about what is borrowed inspiration vs. official material.

| Aesthetic | Honest implementation |
|---|---|
| Glassmorphism / "frosted glass" | `backdrop-filter`, layered borders, highlight overlays. Provide solid-fill fallback for `prefers-reduced-transparency`. |
| Bento (Apple-style tile grids) | CSS Grid with mixed cell sizes. No single library owns this. |
| Brutalism | Native CSS, monospace, raw borders. No library. |
| Editorial / magazine | Serif type, asymmetric grid, generous whitespace. No library. |
| Dark tech / hacker | Mono + accent neon, terminal motifs. No library. |
| Aurora / mesh gradients | **Banned as page/section backdrops** (doctrine, no exceptions - including a full-bleed "brand wash" behind a hero value). Gradients are legal in exactly three homes: inside illustration/photographic artwork (a legibility scrim *on an image* is an image treatment and counts), one editorial accent word in a display heading, or a narrow gradient a codified brand language file already specifies. Chart marks are a convention, not a home: an area fill under a line at ≤15% opacity is fine. Where legal: SVG or layered radial gradients. No library. |
| Kinetic typography | Native CSS animations, scroll-driven animations, GSAP for hijacks. No library. |
| **Apple Liquid Glass** | Apple documents this for Apple platforms only. **There is no official `liquid-glass.css`.** Web implementations are approximations using `backdrop-filter` + layered borders + highlights. Label clearly as approximation. |

---

## 3. DEFAULT ARCHITECTURE & CONVENTIONS

Unless the design read picks a real design system (Section 2.A), these are the defaults:

### 3.A Stack
* **Framework:** React or Next.js. Default to Server Components (RSC).
  * **RSC SAFETY:** Global state works ONLY in Client Components. In Next.js, wrap providers in a `"use client"` component.
  * **INTERACTIVITY ISOLATION:** Any component using Motion, scroll listeners, or pointer physics MUST be an isolated leaf with `'use client'` at the top. Server Components render static layouts only.
* **Styling:** **Tailwind v4** (default). Tailwind v3 only if the existing project demands it.
  * For v4: do NOT use `tailwindcss` plugin in `postcss.config.js`. Use `@tailwindcss/postcss` or the Vite plugin.
* **Animation:** **Motion** (the library formerly known as Framer Motion). Import from `motion/react` (`import { motion } from "motion/react"`). The `framer-motion` package still works as a legacy alias - prefer `motion/react` in new code.
* **Fonts:** Always use `next/font` (Next.js) or self-host with `@font-face` + `font-display: swap`. Never link Google Fonts via `<link>` in production.

### 3.B State
* Local `useState` / `useReducer` for isolated UI.
* Global state ONLY for deep prop-drilling avoidance - Zustand, Jotai, or React context.
* **NEVER** use `useState` to track continuous values driven by user input (mouse position, scroll progress, pointer physics, magnetic hover). Use Motion's `useMotionValue` / `useTransform` / `useScroll`. `useState` re-renders the React tree on every change and collapses on mobile.

### 3.C Icons
* **Allowed libraries (priority order):** `@phosphor-icons/react`, `hugeicons-react`, `@radix-ui/react-icons`, `@tabler/icons-react`.
* **Discouraged:** `lucide-react`. Acceptable only when the user explicitly asks for it or the project already depends on it.
* **NEVER hand-roll SVG icons.** If a glyph is missing, install a second library or compose from primitives - do not draw icon paths from scratch.
* **One family per project.** Do not mix Phosphor with Lucide in the same component tree.
* **Standardize `strokeWidth` globally** (e.g. `1.5` or `2.0`).

### 3.D Emoji Policy
**ZERO emoji in user-facing UI — no exceptions.** Not in code, markup, visible text, headings, alt text, button labels, empty states, or toasts. There is no "playful brief" carve-out; that override is revoked. Replace every symbol with an icon-library glyph from 3.C. The single exception is the user explicitly asking for emoji in this specific task.

### 3.E Responsiveness & Layout Mechanics
* Standardize breakpoints (`sm 640`, `md 768`, `lg 1024`, `xl 1280`, `2xl 1536`).
* Contain page layouts using `max-w-[1400px] mx-auto` or `max-w-7xl`.
* **Viewport Stability:** NEVER use `h-screen` for full-height Hero sections. ALWAYS use `min-h-[100dvh]` to prevent layout jumping on mobile (iOS Safari address bar).
* **Grid over Flex-Math:** NEVER use complex flexbox percentage math (`w-[calc(33%-1rem)]`). ALWAYS use CSS Grid (`grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6`).

### 3.F Dependency Verification (mandatory)
Before importing ANY 3rd-party library, check `package.json`. If the package is missing, output the install command first. **Never** assume a library exists.

---

## 4. DESIGN ENGINEERING DIRECTIVES (Bias Correction)

LLMs default to cliches. Override those defaults proactively; each rule in the reference carries its own context-aware override path.

**Non-negotiables (everything else is in the reference file):**
* **Type:** Inter and its whole family are banned with no override path (pick Geist / Satoshi / Cabinet Grotesk / Clash Display / Outfit / Plus Jakarta Sans); serif is never the default reach, and Fraunces, Instrument Serif, Playfair Display, Cormorant Garamond are banned outright.
* **Color:** one accent, saturation < 80%, locked page-wide; the warm beige/cream + brass/clay + espresso premium-consumer palette is banned as a default reach - rotate to a different family (cold luxury, forest, black-and-tan, cobalt+porcelain, terracotta+slate, olive+brick, mono + one pop), and there is no brief-based override - warmth comes from texture and type, not from the banned band.
* **Layout hard rules:** hero fits the first viewport (headline max 2 lines, subtext max 20 words, max 4 text elements, `pt-24` top-padding cap); nav one line at 64-80px; a layout family appears at most once per page; max 2 consecutive zigzag splits; max 1 eyebrow per 3 sections; bento cells equal the content count, 2-3 of them carrying real visual variation (never a gradient).
* **States, assets, copy:** ship loading/empty/error/active states, contrast-check every button and form (WCAG AA), one CTA label per intent, real generated or sourced imagery instead of div-built fakes, and run the copy self-audit before calling it done.

**Read `references/design-engineering-directives.md`** (sections 4.1-4.11) when choosing type or color, laying out a hero / nav / bento / section rhythm, sourcing images or logos, writing on-page copy, or locking the page theme.
---

## 5. CONTEXT-AWARE PROACTIVITY

These are tools, not defaults. Use them when the design read calls for them. **None of these fire automatically.**

* **Liquid Glass / Glassmorphism:** Appropriate for premium consumer, Apple-adjacent, luxury brand, or media-overlay vibes. Inappropriate for dashboards, public-sector, or "boring B2B." When used, go beyond `backdrop-blur`: add a 1px inner border (`border-white/10`) and a subtle inner shadow (`shadow-[inset_0_1px_0_rgba(255,255,255,0.1)]`) for physical edge refraction. Provide a solid-fill fallback under `prefers-reduced-transparency`.
* **Magnetic Micro-physics:** Use when `MOTION_INTENSITY > 5` AND the brief reads premium / playful / agency. Implement EXCLUSIVELY with Motion's `useMotionValue` / `useTransform` outside the React render cycle. Never `useState`. See Section 3.B.
* **Perpetual Micro-Interactions** (Pulse, Typewriter, Float, Shimmer, Carousel): Use when `MOTION_INTENSITY > 5` AND the section actively benefits from motion (status indicators, live feeds, AI-feel). **Not every card needs an infinite loop.** If a section is informational, leave it still. Apply Spring Physics (`type: "spring", stiffness: 100, damping: 20`) - no linear easing.
* **"Motion claimed, motion shown."** If `MOTION_INTENSITY > 4`, the page must actually move: entry transitions on hero, scroll-reveal on key sections, hover physics on CTAs, at minimum. A static page that claims `MOTION_INTENSITY: 7` is broken. Conversely, if you cannot ship working motion in the available scope, drop the dial to 3 and ship a clean static page. Never half-build motion that breaks (cut-off ScrollTriggers, jumpy enters, missing cleanups).
* **MOTION MUST BE MOTIVATED (mandatory).** Before adding any animation, ask: "what does this animation communicate?" Valid answers: hierarchy (drawing attention to the right thing), storytelling (revealing content in sequence that matches a narrative), feedback (acknowledging a user action), state transition (showing something changed). Invalid answer: "it looked cool". GSAP everywhere because GSAP is available is amateur. Each ScrollTrigger, each marquee, each pinned section needs a reason. If you cannot articulate the reason in one sentence, drop the animation.
* **MARQUEE MAX-ONE-PER-PAGE (mandatory).** Horizontal scrolling text marquees ("logos endlessly scrolling", "manifesto scrolling sideways", "kinetic word strip") are appropriate at most ONCE per page. Two or more marquees on the same page reads as lazy filler. Pick the one section where the marquee actually serves the content; the others get a different layout.
* **GSAP Sticky-Stack Pattern (when scroll-stack is used).** A "card stack on scroll" must be a REAL sticky-stack, not a sequential reveal list. See `references/gsap-skeletons.md` (5.A) for the canonical code skeleton. Common failure: trigger fires halfway through scroll instead of pinning at viewport top. Fix: `start: "top top"` not `start: "top center"` or `"top 80%"`.
* **GSAP Horizontal-Pan Pattern (when horizontal scroll-hijack is used).** See `references/gsap-skeletons.md` (5.B) for the canonical skeleton. Common failure: animation starts before the section is pinned, so the user sees half a slide. Same fix: `start: "top top"`, pin the wrapper, scrub the inner track.

### 5.A-5.C Canonical GSAP Skeletons → `references/gsap-skeletons.md`

The three canonical skeletons — **Sticky-Stack (5.A)**, **Horizontal-Pan (5.B)** and **Scroll-Reveal Stagger (5.C)** — live in **`references/gsap-skeletons.md`**, with the same `start: "top top"` / `pin` / `scrub` rules. Read that file before implementing any pinned or scrubbed scroll section; do not reconstruct these from memory.

### 5.D Forbidden Animation Patterns

* **`window.addEventListener("scroll", ...)`** is banned. It runs on every scroll frame, jank-prone, no batching. Use Motion's `useScroll()`, GSAP's `ScrollTrigger`, IntersectionObserver, or CSS `scroll-driven animations` (`animation-timeline: view()`).
* **Custom scroll progress calculations using `window.scrollY`** in React state. Same reason. Re-renders on every frame.
* **`requestAnimationFrame` loops that touch React state.** Use motion values (`useMotionValue` + `useTransform`) instead.
* **Layout Transitions:** Use Motion's `layout` and `layoutId` props for visible state changes (re-ordering lists, expanding modals, shared elements between routes). Do not wrap static content in `layout` props "for safety" - it costs measurement work.
* **Staggered Orchestration:** Use `staggerChildren` (Motion) or CSS cascade (`animation-delay: calc(var(--index) * 100ms)`) for reveal moments where sequence matters. For `staggerChildren`, parent (`variants`) and children MUST share the same Client Component tree.

---

## 6. PERFORMANCE & ACCESSIBILITY GUARDRAILS

### 6.A Hardware Acceleration
* Animate ONLY `transform` and `opacity`. Never animate `top`, `left`, `width`, `height`.
* Use `will-change: transform` sparingly - only on elements that will actually animate.

### 6.B Reduced Motion (mandatory)
* **Any motion above `MOTION_INTENSITY > 3` MUST honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.** This is non-negotiable.
* In Motion: wrap with `useReducedMotion()` and degrade to static.
* In CSS: gate animations behind `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` or provide an override block under `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` that disables.
* Infinite loops, parallax, scroll-hijack, and magnetic physics MUST collapse to static / instant under reduced motion.

### 6.C Dark Mode (mandatory for any consumer-facing page)
* Design for **both modes from the start**. Never ship light-only or dark-only without explicit user instruction.
* Use Tailwind `dark:` variant OR CSS variables for tokens. Pick one strategy per project.
* **Do not prescribe specific dark-mode colors here.** The brief decides. Maintain visual hierarchy, brand identity, and WCAG AA contrast (AAA for body) across both modes.
* Respect `prefers-color-scheme: dark`. Default to system preference unless the brand insists on one mode.

### 6.D Core Web Vitals Targets
* **LCP** < 2.5s. Hero image must be `next/image priority` or preloaded.
* **INP** < 200ms. Heavy work off main thread.
* **CLS** < 0.1. Reserve space for images, fonts, embeds.
* Run Lighthouse before declaring a page done.

### 6.E DOM Cost
* Apply grain / noise filters EXCLUSIVELY to fixed, `pointer-events-none` pseudo-elements (e.g., `fixed inset-0 z-[60] pointer-events-none`). NEVER on scrolling containers - continuous GPU repaints destroy mobile FPS.
* Be aware of bundle size. Motion is not tiny. Three.js is large. Lazy-load anything that's not above-the-fold.

### 6.F Z-Index Restraint
NEVER spam arbitrary `z-50` or `z-10`. Use z-index strictly for systemic layer contexts (sticky navbars, modals, overlays, grain). Document the z-index scale in a project constants file.

---

## 7. DIAL DEFINITIONS (Technical Reference)

### DESIGN_VARIANCE (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Predictable):** Symmetrical CSS Grid (12-col, equal fr-units), equal paddings, centered alignment.
* **4-7 (Offset):** `margin-top: -2rem` overlaps, varied image aspect ratios (4:3 next to 16:9), left-aligned headers over center-aligned data.
* **8-10 (Asymmetric):** Masonry layouts, CSS Grid with fractional units (`grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr 1fr`), massive empty zones (`padding-left: 20vw`).
* **MOBILE OVERRIDE:** For levels 4-10, asymmetric layouts above `md:` MUST collapse to strict single-column (`w-full`, `px-4`, `py-8`) on viewports `< 768px`.

### MOTION_INTENSITY (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Static):** No automatic animations. CSS `:hover` and `:active` states only. `prefers-reduced-motion` is the default mode anyway.
* **4-7 (Fluid CSS):** `transition: all 0.3s cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)`. `animation-delay` cascades for load-ins. Focus on `transform` and `opacity`.
* **8-10 (Advanced Choreography):** Complex scroll-triggered reveals, parallax, scroll-driven animation (CSS `animation-timeline` or GSAP ScrollTrigger). Use Motion hooks. **NEVER use `window.addEventListener('scroll')`** - it is a hard ban, not a "prefer-not." See Section 5.D for the allowed alternatives.

### VISUAL_DENSITY (Level 1-10)
* **1-3 (Art Gallery):** Lots of white space. Huge section gaps (`py-32` to `py-48`). Expensive, clean.
* **4-7 (Daily App):** Standard web app spacing (`py-16` to `py-24`).
* **8-10 (Cockpit):** Tight paddings. No card boxes; 1px lines separate data. Mandatory: `font-mono` for all numbers.

---

## 8. DARK MODE PROTOCOL

Dual-mode by default. Never assume light-only unless the brief is print-emulating editorial.

### 8.A Token Strategy (pick one, stick to it)
* **Tailwind `dark:` variant** (default for utility-first projects): every color utility paired with its dark variant (`bg-white dark:bg-zinc-950`, `text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100`).
* **CSS variables** (for shadcn/ui, Radix Themes, or component libraries with theming): define semantic tokens (`--surface`, `--surface-elevated`, `--text-primary`, `--accent`) and swap values under `[data-theme="dark"]` or `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`.

### 8.B Do Not Prescribe Specific Colors Here
The brief and brand decide. This skill enforces only:
* **Contrast** - WCAG AA minimum for body text, AAA target for hero copy.
* **Hierarchy parity** - visual hierarchy that works in light must work in dark. If a CTA pops in light, it pops in dark.
* **Brand fidelity** - primary brand color stays recognisable. Don't desaturate the brand into a dark mode.
* **No pure `#000000` and no pure `#ffffff`** - use off-black (zinc-950, near-black warm gray) and off-white. Pure values kill depth.

### 8.C Default Mode
Respect `prefers-color-scheme` unless the brand insists. Add a manual toggle if either mode would lose key brand expression.

### 8.D Test in Both Modes Before Finishing
Open the page in both modes during development. Do not ship a page you've only seen in one mode.

---

## 9. AI TELLS (Forbidden Patterns)

Avoid these signatures unless the brief explicitly asks for them.

**Non-negotiables (the full catalogue is in the reference file):**
* **Zero em-dashes and separator en-dashes anywhere visible** (9.G) - headlines, eyebrows, pills, body copy, quotes, attribution, captions, button text, alt text. Binary rule, no "sparing use" allowance; hyphen and math minus only. A single one fails the Pre-Flight Check.
* **Nothing fake:** div-built product previews and screenshots, "John Doe" names, Acme/Nexus brand slop, fake-perfect or invented-precise numbers, broken Unsplash links, hand-rolled decorative SVGs.
* **No decoration for its own sake:** neon glows, pure `#000000`, gradient headline text, custom cursors, section-number eyebrows, chained middle-dot separators, decorative status dots, scroll cues, locale/time/weather strips, hero decoration text strips, rotated vertical text, crosshair grid lines, version stamps.
* **No lazy structures:** 3-column equal feature cards, oversized H1 as the only hierarchy tool, `border-t` + `border-b` on every row of a long list, Inter (see 4.1).

**Read `references/ai-tells.md`** (sections 9.A-9.G) before the Pre-Flight Check, and whenever you are about to add a label, eyebrow, caption, separator, status dot, or product preview.
---

## 10. REFERENCE VOCABULARY → `references/pattern-vocabulary.md`

The full pattern-name vocabulary (hero paradigms, navigation idioms, grids, card/container forms, scroll animations, galleries, typography moves, micro-interactions, animation-library choice) lives in **`references/pattern-vocabulary.md`**. Read it when choosing a composition or confirming a pattern the brief names.

---

## 11. REDESIGN PROTOCOL

This skill handles **greenfield builds AND redesigns**. Misclassifying the mode is the single biggest source of bad redesign output.

### 11.A Detect the Mode (first action)
* **Greenfield** - no existing site, or full overhaul approved. Dial baseline from Section 1.
* **Redesign - Preserve** - modernise without breaking the brand. Audit first, extract brand tokens, evolve gradually.
* **Redesign - Overhaul** - new visual language on top of existing content. Treat as greenfield for visuals; preserve content and IA.

If ambiguous, ask **once**: *"Should this redesign preserve the existing brand, or are we starting visually from scratch?"*

### 11.B Audit Before Touching
Document the current state before proposing changes:
* **Brand tokens** - primary / accent colors, type stack, logo treatment, radii.
* **Information architecture** - page tree, primary nav, key conversion paths.
* **Content blocks** - what exists, what's doing work, what's filler.
* **Patterns to preserve** - signature interactions, recognisable hero, copy voice.
* **Patterns to retire** - AI-slop tells, broken layouts, dead links, generic stock imagery, perf traps.
* **Dial reading of the existing site** - infer current `DESIGN_VARIANCE` / `MOTION_INTENSITY` / `VISUAL_DENSITY`. That's your starting point, not the baseline.
* **SEO baseline** - current ranking pages, meta titles, structured data, OG cards. **SEO migration is the #1 redesign risk.**

### 11.C Preservation Rules
* **Do not change information architecture** unless asked. Keep page slugs, anchor IDs, primary nav labels stable for SEO and muscle memory.
* **Extract brand colors before applying Section 4.2.** A brand that is already purple stays purple - apply the LILA RULE's override.
* **Preserve copy voice** unless asked for a rewrite. Visual modernisation ≠ content rewrite.
* **Honor existing accessibility wins.** Do not regress focus states, alt text, keyboard nav, contrast.
* **Respect existing analytics events.** Do not rename buttons, form fields, section IDs that downstream tracking depends on.

### 11.D Modernisation Levers (priority order)
Apply in order - stop when the brief is satisfied:
1. **Typography refresh** - biggest visual lift per unit of risk.
2. **Spacing & rhythm** - increase section padding, fix vertical rhythm.
3. **Color recalibration** - desaturate, unify neutrals, keep brand accent.
4. **Motion layer** - add `MOTION_INTENSITY`-appropriate micro-interactions to existing components.
5. **Hero & key-section recomposition** - restructure top-of-funnel using the pattern vocabulary (`references/pattern-vocabulary.md`).
6. **Full block replacement** - only when the existing block is unsalvageable.

### 11.E Decision Tree: Targeted Evolution vs Full Redesign
* IA, content, and SEO sound → **targeted evolution** (Levers 1-4). ~70% of value at ~40% of risk.
* Visual debt is structural (broken IA, no design system, broken mobile) → **full redesign** with strict content preservation.
* Brand itself is changing → **greenfield**.

### 11.F What Never Changes Silently
Never modify without explicit user approval:
* URL structure / route slugs.
* Primary nav labels.
* Form field names or order (breaks analytics + autofill).
* Brand logo or wordmark.

## 12. THE BLOCK LIBRARY (Contract - Implementations Land Here Iteratively)

The Reference Vocabulary (`references/pattern-vocabulary.md`) names patterns. The Block Library implements them with real props, real motion specs, and real code sketches.

**Status:** schema defined here. Blocks will be added iteratively. Do not freelance new blocks without following this schema.

### 12.A File Location
```
skills/taste-skill/blocks/
  hero/
    asymmetric-split.md
    editorial-manifesto.md
    kinetic-type.md
    ...
  feature/
    bento-grid.md
    sticky-scroll-stack.md
    zig-zag.md
    ...
  social-proof/
  pricing/
  cta/
  footer/
  navigation/
  portfolio/
  transition/
```

### 12.B Required Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: asymmetric-split-hero
category: hero
dial_compatibility:
  variance: [6, 10]
  motion: [3, 10]
  density: [2, 5]
when_to_use: "Landing pages with one strong asset and one strong message. Default hero for SaaS, agency, premium consumer."
not_for: "Editorial / manifesto launches where the message IS the design."
stack: ["react", "next", "tailwind", "motion"]
---
```

### 12.C Required Body Sections
1. **Visual sketch** - short ASCII or description of the layout.
2. **Props API** - the component's interface.
3. **Code sketch** - minimal working implementation (Server Component default, Client island for motion).
4. **Mobile fallback** - explicit collapse rules for `< 768px`.
5. **Motion variants** - one variant per `MOTION_INTENSITY` band (1-3, 4-7, 8-10). Reduced-motion fallback explicit.
6. **Dark-mode notes** - token strategy specific to this block.
7. **Anti-patterns** - common ways this block goes wrong.
8. **References** - links to real examples in production.

### 12.D Block-Library Discipline
* One block per file. No multi-block files.
* Every block must work standalone (drop it into a page, it renders).
* Every block must pass the Pre-Flight Check (Section 14).
* Blocks that depend on a design system from Section 2.A live under `blocks/<category>/<name>--<system>.md` (e.g. `feature/bento-grid--material.md`).

## 13. OUT OF SCOPE

This skill is NOT for:
* Dashboards / dense product UI / admin panels (use Fluent, Carbon, Atlassian, or Polaris from Section 2.A).
* Data tables (use TanStack Table or AG Grid).
* Multi-step forms / wizards (use Form-specific patterns; this skill won't make them better).
* Code editors (use Monaco / CodeMirror with their official skinning).
* Native mobile (use Apple HIG / Material directly).
* Realtime collab UIs (presence, cursors, OT-aware - different problem class).

If the brief is one of the above, **say so explicitly**, point to the right tool, and only apply this skill's marketing-page / about-page / landing-page parts to the surfaces where they apply.

## 14. FINAL PRE-FLIGHT CHECK

Run this matrix before outputting code. This is the last filter.

**THIS IS NOT OPTIONAL. Run every box. Every box below can be answered by counting, grepping, or measuring — if you find yourself *judging* instead of *checking*, you are on the wrong list.**

Boxes that could only be answered by remembering a previous session ("different serif from last project") have been removed: no cross-session state exists, so they trained ticking-without-checking across the whole list. Taste, ambition, and register judgement are **not** here — they belong to `master-design`'s gate, which runs after this one (see "Beyond this checklist" below).

**Typography & text**
- [ ] **ZERO em-dashes (`—`)** anywhere on the page — headlines, eyebrows, pills, body, quotes, attribution, captions, buttons, alt text. Grep the diff for `—`; the count must be 0. (Section 9.G — binary, no "sparingly".)
- [ ] **Font grep**: no `Inter` (incl. `Inter Tight` / `Inter Display`), no `Fraunces`, `Instrument_Serif`, `Playfair Display`, `Cormorant Garamond` in any font declaration.
- [ ] **Zero emoji** in code, markup, visible strings, or alt text (Section 3.D).
- [ ] **Italic descender clearance**: every italic display word containing `y g j p q` has `leading-[1.1]` minimum + `pb-1`/`mb-1` reserve.
- [ ] **Body measure** ≤ 65ch; sub-paragraphs ≤ 25 words.

**Counted layout rules**
- [ ] **EYEBROW COUNT**: instances of `uppercase tracking` micro-labels above section headlines ≤ `ceil(sectionCount / 3)`. Hero counts as 1.
- [ ] **Zigzag cap**: no 3+ consecutive sections with the same image+text-split layout.
- [ ] **Layout-family repetition**: no layout family used twice; ≥ 4 distinct families across 8 sections.
- [ ] **Bento cell count**: N content items → exactly N cells. No empty cell mid-grid or trailing.
- [ ] **Marquee count** ≤ 1 per page.
- [ ] **Hero stack** ≤ 4 text elements; headline ≤ 2 lines; subtext ≤ 20 words AND ≤ 4 lines; hero `pt-` ≤ 24 at desktop.
- [ ] **Duplicate CTA intent**: no two CTAs meaning the same thing ("Get in touch" + "Let's talk").
- [ ] **Nav** on one line at desktop, height ≤ 80px.
- [ ] **Quotes** ≤ 3 lines of body.

**Grep-able bans** (each has a fuller entry in Section 9 — this is the sweep)
- [ ] No gradient backdrops anywhere: no mesh, aurora, orb, radial wash, or gradient section/cell background. Bento cells vary via real image, pattern, or tinted surface — **never** a gradient.
- [ ] No `h-screen` (use `min-h-[100dvh]`); no `window.addEventListener('scroll')`; no `calc()` percentage flex math.
- [ ] No hand-rolled SVG icon paths; icons come from one allowed library only (Phosphor / HugeIcons / Radix / Tabler).
- [ ] Section 9 string sweep returns nothing: scroll cues, section-number eyebrows, version labels/footers, decorative photo-credit captions, locale/weather strips, hero bottom text strips, "Quietly in use at", generic names (John Doe / Acme), decorative dots, pills overlaid on images.

**Consistency locks** (one value, applied everywhere — check by listing the distinct values used)
- [ ] **Theme lock**: one theme for the whole page; no section flips to inverted mode.
- [ ] **Accent lock**: exactly one accent color, identical across sections.
- [ ] **Radius lock**: one corner-radius system.
- [ ] **Design-system lock**: one system per project (no Material + shadcn mixed).

**Measured, not estimated**
- [ ] **Contrast**: CTA text, form inputs, placeholders, focus rings and labels each **computed** against their actual background at WCAG AA 4.5:1 — rasterize and measure, never eyeball.
- [ ] **Both themes rendered** and both mode's tokens defined.
- [ ] **Mobile**: explicit `< 768px` collapse declared per multi-column section; page rendered at a mobile width with no horizontal overflow.
- [ ] **Reduced motion** honored wherever `MOTION_INTENSITY > 3`; `useEffect` animations have cleanup; motion isolated in `'use client'` leaves.
- [ ] **Empty / loading / error** states exist for every data-backed surface.
- [ ] **Real images present** (gen-tool → Picsum-seed → labelled placeholder slot). Zero div-based fake screenshots.

**Declared up front** (from Section 0)
- [ ] Brief inference one-liner, dial values reasoned, design system named or aesthetic labelled honestly, redesign audit done if applicable.

If a single checkbox cannot be honestly ticked, the page is not done. Fix it before delivering.

**Beyond this checklist:** taste-level questions — is the aesthetic guessable from the category alone, does the page commit on each of the 8 divergence axes, is the register right — are **not** self-attested here. Run `master-design`'s gate and `impeccable`'s deterministic detectors for those; they exist precisely because reading your own diff cannot answer them.

# APPENDICES → moved to `references/`

The source-backed appendices (install commands, canonical doc links, the honest Apple Liquid Glass approximation) now live in **`references/design-system-appendices.md`**. Read it on demand — see the Reference Index near the top of this file.
